Captains Quarters ./
-----------------
The captain must return here every other night to move the ship. 
Otherwise, the ship will stop moving till the captain returns and puts him in a vulnerable position.
Mutineers get an energy boost when the ship stops moving.
Nothing special for other roles.


Crow's Nest ./
-----------
The player here can choose one room to peek into. At the end of the night, they will receive intel on what occurs in that room. 
Single player so there is no threat here. 


Hammocks ./
--------
Safe room for bucaneers
Mutineers gain energy if they spend time here. 


Oars ./
----
At least one buccaneer must be present every other night to keep ship moving.



Chart Room ./
----------
If the captain visits here consecutively, the ship will then speed up reducing the turns to shore. 
If the mutineers visit consecutively, the ship will stop moving. 


Armoury ./
-------
There is a small chance that a player can gain extra energy for this room. This is by random and only 1 player may receive it. 
Mutineers
